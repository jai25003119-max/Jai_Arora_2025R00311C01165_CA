    <h1>MY ART GALLERY</h1>
    <p>this is the page dedicated to the artworks and some greats arts:</p>
    <p>Below are the details of some famous art pieces and their artists:-</p>
    <h2>1.Mona lisa - by Leonardo da vinci</h2>
    <p>The Mona Lisa is a Renaissance oil portrait by Leonardo da Vinci, created between 1503 and 1519 and now housed in the Louvre Museum in Paris. Believed to depict Lisa del Giocondo, the painting is celebrated for its innovative techniques, particularly sfumato, which creates soft, blurred transitions and contributes to the sitter's enigmatic smile and lifelike presence. The painting's history, including its acquisition by King Francis I of France and its famous 1911 theft and recovery, has further cemented its status as the world's most famous and recognized artwork.</p>

    <h2>3.The Scream -  by Edvard Munch</h2>
    <p>The Scream is a famous art composition created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893, becoming a universal symbol of angst and despair. Inspired by a panic attack Munch experienced, the painting depicts a figure with hands to its ears, blocking out a perceived scream passing through nature under a blood-red sky. The artwork is a seminal example of the Expressionist movement, focusing on intense emotions and distorted forms to convey inner psychological states. </p>

    <h2>4.The Birth of Venus -  by Sandro Botticelli</h2>
    <p>"The Birth of Venus" most commonly refers to Sandro Botticelli's 1485 masterpiece, a painting in the Uffizi Gallery depicting the goddess Venus emerging from the sea on a scallop shell, blown to shore by the wind gods and greeted by Spring. Inspired by Greek and Roman mythology and the Medici family, the painting was a revolutionary work for its use of non-Christian nudity and humanist depiction of beauty, using classical references while also showing a unique, flowing style.</p>
